CFA Coder Screams
==========
For fun, add your sound file to github. Every time you push to a CFA repo, your file will be played in the office. Keep it under 5 secs please ;)

Convention:
==========

mp3 files are preferred.
add your file to somewhere in the sounds/ directory
in the list.yml file, under 'users', add a line in this format:
    GithubUserName: file_name.mp3
    
you can also use your real name (according to github) or your email, if preferred
make sure you have the same amount of indentation.
